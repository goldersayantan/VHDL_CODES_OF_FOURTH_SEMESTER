# ðŸ’¡ VHDL Design Collection â€“ 4th Semester

This repository contains a collection of **VHDL programs** that I developed and practiced during my 4th semester while learning the fundamentals of **Digital Logic Design** and **VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language)**.

## ðŸ“˜ Overview

The repository includes the implementation of various combinational circuits using VHDL, such as:

- Decoder
- Half Adder
- Full Adder
- Half Subtractor
- Full Subtractor
- Four-bit Full Adder
- 16-to-1 Multiplexer

Each design is written in VHDL and can be simulated using tools like **ModelSim**, **Xilinx ISE**, or **Vivado**.

## ðŸ§  Modules Included

| Module              | Description                                       |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `decoder.vhdl`      | Basic binary decoder (e.g., 2-to-4 or 3-to-8)     |
| `half_adder.vhdl`   | Performs addition of 2 bits                       |
| `full_adder.vhdl`   | Adds 2 bits and a carry-in bit                    |
| `half_subtractor.vhdl` | Subtracts two single-bit binary numbers      |
| `full_subtractor.vhdl` | Subtracts two bits and a borrow-in bit       |
| `four_bit_adder.vhdl` | A ripple-carry adder for 4-bit binary numbers |
| `mux_16_to_1.vhdl`  | 16-to-1 multiplexer implementation                |
